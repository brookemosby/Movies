    "## Abstract\n",
    "Cinema has become one of the highest profiting industries over the past century. The total box office revenue in North America alone amounted to $11.38 billion in 2016. With the possibility of great success, there is also a large risk of financial failure. This machine learning analysis is motivated by answering the question what makes a movie successful. There is plenty of quantative data available for movies, such as the movies' budget, the release date, ratings etc., but in this analysis an attempt will be made to quantify movie information that is less measurable and then predict movie success."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Research has been done to determine what aspects of a movie make it more successful; however, much of this research is contradictory. The research paper \"Early Predictions of Movie Success: the Who, What, and When of Profitability\" states movies with a motion picture content rating 'R' will likely have lower profits, whereas the research paper \"What Makes A Great Movie?\" states a motion picture content rating 'R' will have higher a box-office. Both papers analyzed thousands of movies, but came to opposite conclusions. Some variables used to predict movie success in these studies, included budget, motion picture content rating, and actor popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these previous models, the dataset used will include movie title length, run-time, motion picture content rating, director, genre, release date, actors, an actor networking score, budget, opening weekend box-office revenue, and a list of other predictor variables. Movie success will be determined by whether or not the movie turns a profit."

    "## Data Scraped, Downloaded, Cleaned & Engineered\n",
    "### Beginning Dataset\n",
    "A beginning dataset is downloaded from IMDb with 10,000 movies, each entry containing the movie title, URL on IMDb rating, run-time, Year, Genres, Num Votes, Release Date, Directors. From this dataset, additional information on the movie budget, gross income, opening weekend box revenue, actors, Oscar nominations, Oscars won, other award nominations, other awards won, MetaCritic score, and content rating is scraped and cleaned. \n",
    "The data points will be collected from IMDb, which is a reputable source for information, according to their website, \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"we [IMDb] actively gather information from and verify items with studios and \n",
    "filmmakers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data\n",
    "After gathering each data point, the data set is complete, although the information is not clean or uniform. The first step to clean the data will be to remove all commas across each column in the DataFrame. Removing commas will make it easier to convert monetary amounts to ints. Next each date in the Release column will be changed to a pandas date object, which will simplify any calculations that rely on the release date of the movie. Each monetary amount will be converted into an int and converted into USD. Each unique genre will be made into a column, with a true or false boolean for each movie entry.\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "To resolve the disagreement in monetary amounts, due to inflation, a dataset containing the CPI for each year from 1914 will used to adjust the monetary amounts. The CPI, Consumer Price Index, describes the amount of purchasing power the average consumer has. The length of the movie title will be added, and a NetworkX graph of all actors will be made. This network will connect nodes of actors to each other, if they appear in a movie together. The edges of the network will be weighted by the amount of movies the actors appear in together. An actor popularity score will be calculated from the actors appearing in the movie, based on how many other movies they appear in with other actors and the actor's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total variables in the new dataset are movie title, title length, motion picture content rating, run-time, IMDb rating, genres, MetaCritic score, Oscar nominations, Oscar wins, other award nominations, other award wins, director, release date, budget, opening weekend, gross, profit, budget adjusted for inflation, opening weekend adjusted for inflation, gross adjusted for inflation, profit adjusted for inflation, the top ten actors in the movie, and actor popularity score. A separate network will hold the actor nodes and their connections.\n",
    "### Actor Network\n",
    "A network of actors is made to help determine the success of a movie. Each node in the network is an actor that has appeared in a movie, and that actor node will have an edge to another actor node if they appeared in a movie together. The weights on each edge will correspond to the amount of movies the actors, that the edge connects, have appeared in together.\n",

    "## Methods\n",
    "TODO: Look into SVM\n",
    "Various supervised machine learning models were used to predict certain characteristics of the movie that determine a movie's success. The variables that our models attempt to predict are the movie's IMDb rating, Metacritic Score, the number of Oscar nominations, the number of Oscar wins, the number of other award nominations, the number of other award wins, and whether or not a movie turned a profit. These varaibles will hereon be referred to as the movies' dependent variables. For each model the data is split into a training and testing set to determine how accurate each method proves.\n",
    "### PCA\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the large dataset while retaining important information. For each Machine Learning model, PCA is used to reduce dimensionality to 10, 20, and 50 components, and then compared to find the best dimensionality. Because our dataset contains over 100 columns, PCA is essential for our models to avoid extremely costly computations and produce more accurate results.\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "The simple supervised machine learning model, linear regression, attempts to predict the movies' dependent variables. This regression method attempts to predict these variables with a linear approach by modelling the relationship between the scalar and categorical independent variables and the dependent variables, that we have previously determined. Because this is simple to implement and does not contain costly computations, it is a great starting model for our data.\n",
    "### Ridge Regression\n",
    "The ridge regression model is essentially the same as the linear regression model; however, it implements a regularization term to prevent overfitting, and potentially prove more accurate than linear regression.\n",
    "### Random Forest Regression\n",
    "The random forest regression model is a type of additive model that makes predictions by combining decisions from a sequence of base models. A random forest is made by growing multiple binary trees. At each node the data is split into two children nodes, a decision made based on the residual sum of squares, or RSS. For random forests using regression, the predicted value at a node is the average response variable for all observations in the node.\n",
    "### Catboost\n",
    "There exist several implementations of random forest boosters, among these are GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Catboost. Catboost seems to outperform the other implementations, even by using only its default parameters. Not only is it more accurate, but also faster than the other methods, making it an ideal machine learning model to implement on our dataset. In Boosting each tree is grown using information from previously learned trees, then each tree is fitted on a modified version of the original data set. Because the random forest regression gave the best results, the next natural step was to examine how Catboost performed on our dataset.\n",
    "### Neural Network\n",
    "Neural networks are one of the biggest advancements in machine learning in the 21st century. A neural network is based on a collection of connected nodes, or neurons. In nerual network implementations, the output of each node is calculated by a non-linear loss function based on the sum of its inputs. The edges in the network typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases based on the sum of the inputs. Neurons may have a threshold for the sum of inputs, before they are activated. Typically, neurons are organized in layers, where different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. In our implementation, the neural network was costly to compute, so only the profit boolean was predicted with the neural network."

    "Regarding the results of this model,there are very few things that linear regression can predict accurately. It is important to note that the best estimator was PCA with 50 components, which is the largest number of components used in the predictions. There are some variables that seem to have potential for a large increase in accuracy The first notable varaible is the IMDb rating, with has an error percentage of about 10% with potential to be increased. The Oscar nominations and wins are predicted extremely accurately from linear regression alone, and the boolean for whether or not a movie returns a profit is correct more than 70% of the time, which is perhaps one of the most important variables movie producers will look for, and one that will hopefully have better accuracy with different models. Other variables do poorly when predicted with linear regression."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After analyzing the results of all the machine learning algorithms implemented, it becomes apparent that determining the success of a movie is very difficult. Some characteristics of movies, such as word of mouth appeal, are very difficult to quantify. Including an actor network score into our models improved the accuracy of our predictions, however there are still many other variables to account for that detract from the accuracy. It is worth noting that every regressor model failed to accuractely estimate the profit a movie turned, because this value was extremely unpredicatable. Because Catboost was so fast and inherently more accurate, it enabled us to fine tune more than other models, to produce the most accurate predictions. Overall Catboost performed the best."
