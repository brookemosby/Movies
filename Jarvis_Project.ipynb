    "## Introduction\n",
    "Cinema has become one of the highest profiting industries over the past century. The total box office revenue in North America alone amounted to $11.38 billion in 2016. With the possibility of great success, there is also a large risk of financial failure. This data exploration is motivated by answering the question what makes a movie successful. Specifically do higher budgets mean that a movie will be more profitable? Does the date of release affect the movies profit? Is the box office revenue for the opening weekend of a movie a good predictor of the profit of a movie? Answering these questions could save cinema production companies millions."

    "## Data Scraped, Downloaded & Cleaned\n",
    "To begin the data investigation, a collection of movies will be needed to gather data on. To accomplish this, movie names will be scraped from the rotten tomatoes top 100 movies for each genre. There are 17 different genres listed, although some movies are listed in multiple genres, and not every genre contains a full list of 100 movies. In total, after eliminating duplicates, there will be 937 distinct movies collected. The collection of movie names will be biased towards more successful productions, although the large selection will resolve some of the bias introduced by the selection method."

    "After gathering each data point, the data set is complete, although the information is not clean or uniform. The first step to clean up the names and release dates, will be to remove any phrases in parenthesis across the rows of the DataFrame. Following the removal of parenthesis, will be the removal of all commas across each column in the DataFrame. Removing commas will make it easier to convert monetary amounts to ints. Next each date in the Release column will be changed to a pandas date object, which will simplify any calculations that rely on the release date of the movie. Finally each monetary amount will be converted into an int, while creating place holder columns for the currency type of the budget and opening weekend revenue. The gross income column of the movie DataFrame is listed in USD solely, so this value will not need a place holder column for it. The dataset is now cleaned, although the information is not given in uniform units, which will need to be addressed."

    "### Converting Currency to USD\n",
    "The next step in unifying the currency units is to convert all monetary amounts into USD. Converting each column to USD will make comparisons valid, and is accomplished by using a dataset which contains the exchange rates for 26 different currencies to USD, for dates throughout the past century. For currencies not listed in USD, the release date of the movie will be used to find the accurate exchange rate to USD, after which the currency will be converted to USD. Once the conversations are calculated, the place holder columns describing the original currency are dropped, resulting in a clean and uniform dataset."

    "Some adjustments to the dataset will be needed in order to better understand the data. First it will be beneficial to create a column corresponding to the decades of the movies' release date. A column that identifies the profit of the movie will be crucial in determining the financial success of the movie. To create a Profit column, the budget of the movie will be subtracted from the gross income. Finally, there is one remaining issue to be addressed. Because the movies in the dataset span the past century the monetary amounts are not adjusted for inflation, making them difficult to compare directly. To resolve the disagreement between the monetary amounts, a dataset containing the CPI for each year from 1914 will used to adjust for inflation. The CPI, Consumer Price Index, describes the amount of purchasing power the average consumer has. To account for inflation, the current CPI is divided by the CPI of the year when the movie was released to obtain a ratio of purchasing power. The monetary amounts are multiplied by this ratio, resulting in a new monetary amount corresponding to the approximate amount with today's purchasing power. The budget, opening weekend revenue, gross income, and profit of each movie will be adjusted for inflation, and placed into new columns. With the adjusted inflation columns, relationships between variables may become more apparent."

    "The heatmap above gives the strengths of the correlations coefficients, on a scale of -1.0 to 1.0. 1.0 is perfectly positively correlated, and -1.0 is perfectly negatively correlated, meaning each variable will positively correlate to itself perfectly. The heatmap gives some interesting relationships between variables. There were no strong correlations between the unadjusted variables, and thus were excluded from the heatmap above. The first relationship worth notice, is that the later in the century a movie was produced, the worse the adjusted profit and adjusted gross income of the movie would be. A second relationship that needs investigation is the perfect positive correlation between the adjusted gross and the adjusted profit. Since the adjusted profit is calculated from the adjusted gross income, it is reasonable that they would be strongly positively correlated, although extremely unlikely that this would be a perfect relationship. The correlation coefficient for the relationship between the adjusted gross income and the adjusted profit is 0.978601533586, which is strongly positive, although not perfect, as the rounded number in the heatmap would suggest. It is interesting to note that from this heatmap, it seems as though the adjusted budget has little correlation to the adjusted profit. The relationships between the adjusted profit for a movie, and the adjusted budget, adjusted gross income, and adjusted opening weekend revenue still need to be investigated. There may be some intuition to gain from looking at the linear regression for each relationship, which would be the next step in the data exploration."

    "From the graphs above, it is clear that the gross income is the best estimator for the profit, mainly because profit is calculated from the gross income. However the gross income is only useful to estimate the profit, if the variable for the budget is not available. The second best variable for predicting the profit is the opening weekend revenue. The opening weekend revenue may be a more useful predictor for profit than the gross income, because it can give insight into what the profit of a movie may be before it leaves theaters. It is interesting that there is almost no correlation between the budget of a movie, and the profit the movie makes."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Unfortunately there does not seem to be a large correlation between the budget of a movie, and the profit of the production. This suggests that spending large amounts of money on a movie production does not necessarily pay off.  After looking into all the dataset variables, there was little information to be gained from the motion picture content rating, the rotten tomatoes score, and the unadjusted monetary amounts. One of the most useful predictors for the profit of a movie seems to be the opening weekend revenue, which is intuitive. A larger dataset of movies could present more correlations, due to time constraints this dataset was limited to ~1000 movie titles.  More information that could be used as predictors for the profit of a movie would be money and time spent into marketing the movie, and the amount of different trailers released. These variables may play a larger role and factor into what makes a movie more profitable and successfull. Also, collecting information on DVD sales once the movie left the theater could give more insight into just how profitable, or successful the movie was."
